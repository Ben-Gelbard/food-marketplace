# Short Answer Questions

1. **What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?**
```
People grow food, but often they grow too much, or it becomes ripe all at once. Ventopia allows growers to connect to consumers, and sell the excess produce from their gardens, before it goes off.
Additionally Ventopia allows for cafes restaurants to alert users to products going off that they want to sell cheap.
```

2. **Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

```
The problem is that there is a lot of excess food that gets wasted every year. For example the Huffington Post reports that Australians waste $10 billion a year on food that’s thrown away. Our app plans to reduce that.
