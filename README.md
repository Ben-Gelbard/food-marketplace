## What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

Our project is a virtual farmers market and food trading marketplace for local urban growers and small cafes. 

## Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

 Melbourne has a lot of urban farms within it's suburbs which sometimes see a lot of food being produced, this along with fruit trees on ones property sometimes more food than can be consumed before it goes off is present. This marketplace will provide a means for these urban farmers to sell and trade food they produce to people within their neighborhoods. Let's say that the lemon tree on your property has fruited with an abundance of lemons, this marketplace will allow you to post these lemons and perhaps trade them with some fresh eggs that a nearby neighbor has too many of from their chickens. This app will provide a way for local produce to be traded and sold around Melbourne.

 This app would also be useful to small cafes and bakeries who have leftover stock in the afternoon. Most baked goods won't be resold the next day, with this marketplace a cafe could make a listing an hour before they close to market their goods at a discounted price and avoid potentially throwing them out if the day comes to a close. You could be walking down the street and see that a cafe nearby is trying to get rid of their last few muffins for cheap. Then you get cheap muffins.
